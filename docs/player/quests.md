# Quests

Quests can be obtained from all churches. 
The game has a basic fetch quest for now.
Players will receive a quest item (a card) when they reach the quest point.
Using that item activates the quest. 
Collect 2 meat by killing a deer and return back to that church, which would now be a beacon.
Players get money as reward.
