## Markets

Cities have markets where players can buy or sell items. 
All markets will have a grey _Market Citizen_ nearby. 
Interact with the citizen to bring up the market UI. 
The selling UI is given below as an example.

## Trading

Players can trade with some citizens. 
Trade depends on the market costs of the items being proposed.
You first have to pick an item that you want from the left list and propose an item that you'll trade from the right list.
If the costs of the items are almost equal, then the trade _might_ be expected by the citizen with some predefined probability.
