# The Old West

The map is an almost flat desert terrain with some mountains peppered here and there. 
There are settlements that evolve with time and are home to our various factions in the game. 
New cities, when found, are connected with rail roads. 
When players find a city, it is marked on their minimap.

 All cities have our NPCs with whom you can trade and have marketplaces where you can buy or sell items. 
 For more information regarding these, see [trade and markets](player/trade-and-markets).
